## Geek Code 6.x

# What Is Geek Code?
The Geek Code was developed in 1993 as a system of letters and symbols used by self-proclaimed "geeks" to provide information about their personality, appearance, interests, skills, and opinions to other geeks.

This code aims to offer a brief yet comprehensive depiction of one's self within the realm of geek culture. It covers key dimensions using a limited number of categories, which are further specified with qualifiers or quantifiers. The goal is to encode everything that defines a geek's individuality into a compact format that only other geeks can comprehend, which is thought to be an efficient approach within geek culture.

By sharing your geek code with friends and acquaintances, you can help them understand that today's geeks are the trendsetters of tomorrow.

Older Versions
------
Robert A. Hayden, a student and later a graduate of Mankato State University, created and wrote Version 0.1 of the Geek Code, which only had about five categories. Version 0.2 focused on correcting spelling and bugs, while Version 0.3 added a few more categories.

The web links provided in this text are some of the earliest examples of the Geek Code still surviving on the internet. In the case that these websites disappear or stop loading, a backup of the old code has been created for posterity in this GitHub repository.

[Click here to see Version 0.3 on the web!](https://www.cs.cmu.edu/afs/cs/user/scotts/ftp/bulgarians/geek-code.html "This is perhaps the oldest still surviving example of Geek Code on the web!")

Version 1.0 was released four months after 0.3, on July 17, 1993, and added several more categories, along with rules for cross-overs and variables.

[Click here to see Version 1.0.1 here!](http://www.textfiles.com/100/codegeek.txt)

Version 2.0 was released a year after Version 1.0, and at least 75 additions were included in that version, representing the recommendations of dozens of people. This milestone also signifies the moment when the geek code had expanded to such an extent that it ultimately needed to undergo revision in order to maintain internal coherence.

Version 3.x, which was released on March 5, 1996, was a significant refinement over Version 2.x, aimed at eliminating many of the non-geeky categories to make room for more geeky traits. Some of the odd categories that were removed in 3.x included automobiles, nutrition, and even Barney.

The geekcode Linux package, which is presently accessible on Debian and Ubuntu, operates on Version 3.12. However, it is imperative to note that this Linux package solely comprises the rudimentary form of the Version 3 Geek Code and is bereft of support for crossovers and variables.

[Version 3.1 Generator](https://www.joereiss.net/geek/geek.html)

[Version 3.1 Decoder](http://www.ebb.org/ungeek/ "Real geeks shouldn't need this though.")

Version 4.x was released on GitHub on October 18, 2019, with some categories removed, added, and altered.

[Click here to see Version 4.0!](https://github.com/telavivmakers/geek_code/blob/8903d925d6660d9afa661d6cb99f13976d95242f/README.md)

Version 5.0 eliminated case-sensitive categories and modified some letters and categories. The latest versions of the Geek Code are aimed at giving geeks a better platform to express their interests.


Welcome to The Geek Code Version 6.0
======

This updated edition has been revised by ChatGPT, who has improved the language for better comprehension, flow, and enriched vocabulary. Additionally, all spelling, grammar, and punctuation mistakes have been rectified.

Although the original content remains unaltered, we classify this as a fresh rendition, as the alterations made to the text were significant, and the modern AI approach taken to refine it is unique from previous versions.


How Does It Work?
------

The code is made up of alphanumeric identifiers that represent different categories and subcategories. Following these identifiers are qualifiers, represented by the symbols + and -, that indicate factors such as amount, size, or level of proficiency. These qualifiers can be stacked to provide more specific information, such as `H+++`, which indicates an individual with an extremely high level of skill in Hardware.

The broad categories that can be encoded are: Geek of, Wetware, Computers, Politics, Entertainment, and Lifestyle. Each category has its own subcategories, and you can provide as much or as little detail as you like. For example, `U++` indicates a person with a high level of interest or proficiency in Unix, while `ULDU++` indicates someone with a particular interest in Unix/Linux/Debian/Ubuntu. Additional subcategories can be indicated with a forward slash, such as `GCS/GM`, which indicates a Geek of Computer Science and Math.

Some categories may not be relevant to you, so you can ignore them. Also, some of the qualifiers may not be a perfect match for your level of proficiency or interest, so choose the qualifier that most closely reflects your abilities.

Once you have provided a set of category/qualifier strings for any of the above, it's time to assemble your code for display. Simply concatenate the substrings with a space between them. Your final code might look something like this:

```
GCS^/GM^ A++(a?) B_:--:+:-:+ C++(C-) D+:+ CM++(++++) MW11_(++) ULD++++$ MC-- Lbash+++/LC#+/Lj+/Lpy++/Lvb IO+++:---(+) G:exarobibliologist E++ H+ PGP PSG PE TDW+/TEX+++/THRO++++/TMON+++/TOB+++/TSTsnw+++/TSTld+++/TSTdsc-- RPG+++(*)>$ BK+++ KX+++ INTJ-A R-- he/him+++
```

When it comes to sharing code, using a long line can be unwieldy and difficult to read for the user. To improve the readability, it's advisable to incorporate line breaks in between certain categories. This approach can help create a rough box shape that makes the code more accessible and easier to follow.

```

Special characters
------

A few special characters allow for the (ultimately wrong but practically useful) notion that geeks can seldom be strictly quantified.

|			|			|				|
|:---		|	:---:	|	:---		|
|	`+`		|	=		|	indicates an increased amount of geekiness in a particular area. Each additional + raises the level further.	|
|	`_`		|	=		|	(Optional) indicates a baseline answer. _ is one step above -, and one step below +. Therefore, _ is never combined with + or -. For example, instead of leaving it blank/empty, a geek of average shape and size could write d_:_ to indicate they are at the baseline.	|
|	`-`		|	=		|	indicates a decreased amount of geekiness in a particular area. Each additional - reduces the level further.	|
|	`@`		|	=		|	for this variable, said trait is not very rigid and may change with time or with individual interaction. For example, Geeks who happen to very much enjoy Star Trek: Picard as a whole, but aren't sure how they like the current season might list themselves as TSTpic+++@.	|
|	`()`	|	=		|	for indicating "cross-overs" or ranges. Geeks who go from C+ to C— depending on the situation (i.e. mostly "C+") could use C+(—). Note: @ is different from () in that () has finite limits within the category, while @ ranges all over.	|
|	`$`		|	=		|	Indicates that this particular category is done for a living. For example, UL+++$ indicates that the person utilizes Unix and gets paid for it. Quite a lucky geek, for sure.	|
|	`^`		|	=		|	Indicates that the geek has a degree or certificate in this area or field. For example, GCS^/GMU/GTW^ indicates that this is a Geek of Computer Science (with a degree in this field), a Geek of Music, and a Geek of Technical Writing (with a certificate in this field)	|
|	`>`		|	=		|	for 'wannabe' ratings. Indicating that while the geek is currently at one rating, they are striving to reach another. For example, UL+++>$ indicates a geek that is currently Linux savvy but wants to someday make money at it.	|
|	`?`		|	=		|	Unless stated otherwise within the specific category, the ? is placed after the category identifier and indicates that the geek has no knowledge about that specific category.	|
|	`!`		|	=		|	Placed BEFORE the category. Unless stated otherwise, indicates that the person refuses to participate in this category. This is unlike the ? variable as the ? indicates a lack of knowledge, while the ! indicates stubborn refusal to participate. For example, !MC would be a person that just plain refuses to have anything to do with Macintosh, while MC? would be a person that doesn't even know what Macintosh is.	|

The categories
======

G = GEEK OF - training/degree/interest/job
======

In order for a person to commence coding, they must first identify themselves as a geek. This is achieved by beginning the code with a "G" which stands for "GEEK", followed by one or two letters that indicate the geek's profession or area of expertise. Geeks who possess multiple skill sets in various vocations should utilize a slash to distinguish each of their talents (e.g., GCS/MU/TW) and showcase their multifaceted abilities.

WETWARE (A,B,C,D) (age/beard/clothing/dimensions)
======

It is often said that first impressions are crucial and can never be undone. However, The Geek holds a different opinion. As per an ancient meme, "on the internet, it's impossible to distinguish a person from a dog". Despite that, this section provides an opportunity to disclose information about one's appearance, possibly for dating reasons or other trivial matters. Moreover, it enables us to kickstart with the basics, denoting age, beard, clothing, and dimensions using the abbreviations 'ABCD.'

A = Age
------

The only way to become a true geek is through practice and experience. To this end, your age becomes an important part of your geekiness. Employ the following descriptions to indicate your age in Terran years, using a base 10 system, of course.

|				|			|				|
|:---			|	:---:	|	:---		|
|	`A++++`		|	=		|	60+			|
|	`A+++`		|	=		|	50-59		|
|	`A++`		|	=		|	40-49		|
|	`A+`		|	=		|	30-39		|
|	`A`			|	=		|	25-29		|
|	`A-`		|	=		|	20-24		|
|	`A--`		|	=		|	15-19		|
|	`A---`		|	=		|	10-14		|
|	`A----`		|	=		|	9 and under (Geek in training?)	|
|	`A?`		|	=		|	immortal?	|
|	`!A`		|	=		|	it's none of your business how old I am	|
|	`A=##`		|	=		|	Share your exact age by placing a number after. For example: A=42	|

B = Beardliness/Hair
------

Facial hair has a significant presence in the geek community, serving as a means of expressing one's personal style and countercultural leanings. Although the concept of ["unix beards"](http://www.usenix.org.uk/content/unix_beards.html) may not apply to everyone, it still deserves recognition and inclusion in this category.

The hair code is divided into five distinct parts, each separated by a colon. These parts are (Head : Beard : Brows : Mustache : Sideburns)

|				|			|				|
|:---			|	:---:	|	:---		|
|	`+++`		|	=		|	At times, onlookers may perceive me as a Sasquatch due to the excessive amount of hair I possess	|
|	`++`		|	=		|	Good hair growth!	|
|	`+`			|	=		|	Above average hair growth	|
|				|	=		|	Average	|
|	`-`			|	=		|	Less than normal, partially shaved	|
|	`--`		|	=		|	Bald / Shaved	|
|	`---`		|	=		|	Alopecia / Unable to grow hair there	|

Thus `B_:++:+:++:_` means that geek has an average head of hair, with an impressive beard, thick brows, an equally impressive mustachio, and ordinary sideburns.


C = Clothing
------

|				|			|				|
|:---			|	:---:	|	:---		|
|	`C++`		|	=		|	I have a tendency to opt for more traditional and formal attire, such as a sharp business suit, and on occasion, I may even wear a tie.	|
|	`C+` 		|	=		|	Appropriate attire for leisure activities includes slacks and a button-up shirt, among other options. Jeans, tennis shoes, and t-shirts should be avoided.	|
|	`C`			|	=		|	My wardrobe bears a striking resemblance to those depicted in catalog advertisements. The pieces lack any unique characteristics, are uninteresting, and fail to convey a sense of purpose or individuality.	|
|	`C-`		| 	=		|	My typical attire consists of jeans and a comfortable t-shirt.	|
|	`C--`		|	=		|	My t-shirts are not just ordinary pieces of clothing. They boast a stylish political message, making them all the more unique and fashionable.	|
|	`C---`		|	=		|	My punk fashion style can encompass a variety of elements such as distressed denim pants and tops, as well as body adornments like piercings and bold tattoos.	|
|	`Cx`		|	=		|	Cross Dresser	|
|	`C?`		|	=		|	I have no idea what I am wearing right now, let alone what I wore yesterday.	|
|	`!C`		|	=		|	No clothing. Quite a fashion statement, don't you think?	|
|	`Cpu`		|	=		|	I have a tendency to wear the exact same attire consistently, disregarding the type of event or activity I'm attending. This is mainly due to my forgetfulness in washing my garments in between wearings.	|

D = Dimensions
------

People who are considered geeks come in a wide variety of forms. The initial portion indicates the vertical extent, while the latter represents the horizontal extent. The two parts are delimited by a colon.

|				|			|	Vertical Extent							|	Horizontal Extent				|
|:---			|	:---:	|	:---									|	:---							|
|	`+++:+++` 	|	=		|	I usually have to duck through doors	|	I take up three movie seats.	|
|	`++:++` 	|	=		|	I'm a basketball candidate.				|	I'm a linebacker candidate		|
|	`+:+` 		|	=		|	I'm a little taller than most.			|	I'm a little rounder than most	|
|	`:` 		|	=		|	Geek of average height					|	Geek of average width			|
|	`-:-`		|	=		|	I look up to most people. 				|	Everyone tells me to gain a few pounds.	|
|	`--:--` 	|	=		|	I look up to damn near everybody.		|	I tend to have to fight against a strong breeze.	|
|	`---:---` 	|	=		|	I take a phone book with me when I go out so I can see to eat dinner. 	|	My bones are poking through my skin.	|

Example: `D+++:---` indicates extremely tall and thin.

CM = COMPUTERS
======

It is a known fact that there existed a group of individuals who were classified as geeks, but surprisingly they did not use computers. However, their era was devoid of such technology, and unfortunately, they are all no longer alive.

In this day and age, it is expected that geeks have some level of familiarity with computers. If, for some reason, you have no idea what a computer is, it's high time you acquaint yourself with the technology.

For many geeks, their identity is closely tied to their proficiency in using computers and computer networks. To evaluate your level of geekiness when it comes to computers, consult the following guide. This first category will serve as a general indicator of your computer aptitude, while the subsequent categories delve into more specific areas.

|				|			|				|
|:---			|	:---:	|	:---		|
|	`CM++++` 	|	=		|	I want to be the first in line to have the cutting-edge cybernetic interface implanted into my body.	|
|	`CM+++`		|	=		|	"Are you telling me that there's more to life than just being online? It's been weeks since I last logged out. I've been spending my time on StackOverflow, providing answers to various questions."	|
|	`CM++` 		|	=		|	As someone who has embraced the digital age, computers are an integral component of my everyday life. I am adept at coding in at least one programming language and frequently refer to StackOverflow to resolve any technical queries that I encounter.	|
|	`CM+`		|	=		|	I find computers to be entertaining and fun to use. Furthermore, I possess enough knowledge that when prompted with the instruction 'press any key to continue', I need not scour the keyboard in search of a specific key labeled 'ANY'.	|
|	`CM`		|	=		|	Computers are a mere instrument, devoid of any intrinsic value. I resort to its employment solely when it is conducive to accomplishing my goals.	|
|	`CM-`		|	=		|	If I encounter anything that goes beyond the capabilities of my calculator, I am in serious trouble.	|
|	`CM--`		|	=		|	Where's the on switch?	|
|	`CM---`		|	=		|	"Computers? No thank you. Aren't those the devices possessed by demons?"	|

MW = Microsoft Windows
------

A good many geeks suffer through the use of various versions of Microsoft Windows.

Let us know the extent of your expertise by rating your level of "Windows geekiness". Feel free to include the versions of Windows you have had experience with, or are currently utilizing. To give an example, a rating of `MW11+++` indicates that you possess exceptional proficiency in using Windows 11.
|				|			|				|
|:---			|	:---:	|	:---		|
|	`MW++++`	|	=		|	As an expert in MS Windows programming, I have successfully crafted and compiled more than one executable file (.exe), installation package (.msi), or dynamic link library (.dll). My proficiency in this field is unparalleled, and I take pride in my ability to deliver top-notch results.	|
|	`MW+++`		|	=		|	I specialize in compiling code for Microsoft platforms.	|
|	`MW++`		|	=		|	I have utilized my knowledge of Windows REGEDIT to bypass security protocols and remedy a number of glitches on my personal computer. Some people think I'm a hacker.	|
|	`MW+`		|	=		|	My computer is an ultimate expression of my personal style, with customized sounds, wallpapers, and screen savers that bring the fun house to my desktop. I've even gone as far as installing an impressive array of a hundred fonts, though I've yet to find the perfect opportunity to use them.	|
|	`MW`		|	=		|	Although I utilize Windows solely for a particular reason such as playing games on Steam, I must admit that I do not necessarily enjoy its use.	|
|	`MW-`		|	=		|	I'm always have trouble installing MS Windows on my device, and frequently I face issues with one of my peripherals that does not function properly.	|
|	`MW--`		|	=		|	MS Windows is a joke operating system. No one can find the error codes anymore, and even if they could no one can read hexadecimal to understand them!	|
|	`MW---`		|	=		|	Windows has set back the computing industry by at least 10 years. Bill Gates should be drawn, quartered, hung, shot, poisoned, disemboweled, and then REALLY hurt.	|

U = Unix
------

It appears that most tech enthusiasts prefer a Unix-based operating system. In order to showcase your proficiency with Unix, it is helpful to identify the specific Unix OS that you utilize. This can be done by incorporating a letter in your rating that denotes the brand. As an example, `UL++++` signifies that you are a system administrator operating on Linux.

````
	U = Unix
		UL = Linux
			ULA = Arch
				ULAP = Pacman
			ULD = Debian
				ULDU = ubuntu
					ULDUM = Linux Mint
					ULDU* = 3rd party/discontinued ubuntu
				ULDD = Deepin
			ULF = Fedora
			ULRH = Red Hat Enterprise Linux
				ULRC = Centos
				ULRO = OpenSUSE
			ULG = Gentoo
				ULGC = ChromeOS / ChromiumOS
			ULS = Slackware
			UL* = other
		US = Sun OS/Solaris
		UA = AIX

		UI = IRIX
		UC = SCO Unix
	U* = Some other one not listed
````
some examples

|				|			|				|
|:---			|	:---:	|	:---		|
|	`U++++`		|	=		|	I am the sysadmin. I caution against attempting to breach the security of my computer. If you do, don't be shocked if the municipal works department receives an "unintentional" computer-generated request to commence construction on a new landfill on your property.	|
|	`U+++`		|	=		|	There's no need for me to crack into /etc/passwd since I've made a modification to su that eliminates the need for a prompt. As a result, the admin staff is unaware of my presence.	|
|	`U++`		|	=		|	I have managed to annoy the entire administration as a result of my constant utilization of all the CPU time and attempts to run programs that are beyond my authorized access.	|
|	`U+`		|	=		|	I enjoy shell scripting and understand the fundamental importance of the difference between ' and `	|
|	`U`			|	=		|	I have a Unix account to do my stuff in	|
|	`U-`		|	=		|	I have a VMS account.	|
|	`U--`		|	=		|	I've seen Unix and didn't like it. DEC rules!	|
|	`U---`		|	=		|	Unix geeks are actually nerds in disguise.	|

MC = Mac/Apple
------

Numerous technology enthusiasts have made the switch from personal computers to Apple products. Kindly inform us of your Mac rating.

|				|			|				|
|:---			|	:---:	|	:---		|
|	`MC++`		|	=		|	As a highly skilled Mac expert, I possess a vast array of knowledge and capabilities. I am confident in my ability to outperform those individuals who specialize in other operating systems such as DOS or Unix. Even in cases where I may not have immediate expertise, I possess the skills and ingenuity necessary to create the software required to accomplish any task.	|
|	`MC+`		|	=		|	A Mac serves various purposes, and I frequently utilize it in my daily activities.	|
|	`MC` 		|	=		|	Although I utilize a Mac, my feelings towards it are relatively ambivalent.	|
|	`MC-` 		|	=		|	Macs are inferior. True technology enthusiasts only use a command line interface, or a character prompt, for their computing needs.	|
|	`MC--`		| 	= 		|	Macs do more than suck. They make a user stupid by allowing them to use the system without knowing what they are doing. Mac weenies have lower IQs than the fuzz in my navel.	|

L = Programming Languages
------

List a series of languages and your facility/opinion thereupon, for example, `Lpy++/LR+` would indicate high proficiency in python and above-average knowledge of R.

|				|			|				|
|:---			|	:---:	|	:---		|
|	`Lasm` 		|	=		|	Assembly			|
|	`Lbash`		|	=		|	Bourne Again Shell	|

|	`Lsql` 		|	=		|	SQL					|
|	`Lvb`		|	=		|	Visual Basic		|
|	`Lwps`		|	=		|	Windows PowerShell	|

For example:

|				|			|				|
|:---			|	:---:	|	:---		|
|	`Lpy+++`	|	=		|	I am Guido van Rossum	|
|	`Lpy++`		|	=		|	I maintain and provide contributions  to the Python code base.	|
|	`Lpy+`		|	=		|	As a devoted Python enthusiast, I consistently utilize this programming language in my work. I take pride in aligning my statements with the principles of "pythonic" coding.	|
|	`Lpy`		|	=		|	I am neutral towards Python; it is decent for certain purposes.	|
|	`Lpy-`		|	=		|	Python is a programming language for hobbiests	|
|	`Lpy--` 	|	=		|	I hold a strong aversion towards python; it appears to be an unsightly deviation that only caters to those who are unable to comprehend the intricate capabilities of [C|Lisp|assembly].	|


IO = Input/Output
------

How do you go about handling your data? And, once you have it, how do you effectively communicate it to others? Input/Output, consisting of two distinct sections separated by a colon, determines just how easily you are able to navigate and make sense of your data.

|			|			|	Input		|		Output		|
|:---		|	:---:	|	:---		| 	:---			|
|	`+++`	|	=		|	I wrote my own database system as current performance limitations were irking me	|	I am a java bean 	|
|	`++`	|	=		|				|					|
|	`+`		|	=		|				|					|
|			|	=		|	Uses mouse and keyboard equally	|	Uses mouse and keyboard equally	|
|	`-`		|	=		|				|					|
|	`--`	|	=		|				|	My user interface is a text-only Terminal. Don't even touch the mouse	|
|	`---`	|	=		|	Keep the data and code out of sight. I focus on creating an attractive graphical user interface for maximum impact.	|	The concept of 'user experience' holds no significance to me. In my view, users can be effectively studied and understood through Bayesian techniques.	|

For example: `IO+++:---` indicates that you will be dealing with data in its most unprocessed form, both in receiving and transmitting it.

Pretty Good Privacy (aka PGP) is a program available on many platforms that will encrypt files so that prying eyes (particularly governmental) can't look at them.

|	`PGP++++`	|	=		|	I am Philip Zimmerman	|
|	`PGP+++`	|	=		|	I don't send or answer mail that is not encrypted, or at the very least signed. If you are reading this without decrypting it first, something is wrong. IT DIDN'T COME FROM ME!	|

|	`PGP----` 	|	=		|	Oh, here is something you all can use that is better (insert Clipper here).	|

POLITICS
======

The last few years have seen the rise of the political geek. This phenomenon is little understood, but some theorize that it has come about because of the popular media's attempts to demonize the Internet and computer use in general, and the government's willingness to go along with it. Others propose that the aging geek population has simply started taking an interest in the world around them. Some support the "Sun Spot" theory.

Politics and Social Issues
------

Where, in general, your political views on different social issues fall. The + and – ratings here roughly indicate left/right on the political spectrum.

Subcategories (give yourself a geek point if your first thought was 'actually, subsubcategories') As of v4 some new subcategories are added to the PS and PE categories.

```
	PSG = green politics/sustainability/climate
	PSL = civil liberties
	PSS = gender politics
```

|				|			|				|
|:---			|	:---:	|	:---		|
|	`PS+++`		|	=		|	Legalize drugs! Abolish the government. "Fuck the draft!"	|
|	`PS++`		|	=		|	I give to liberal causes. I march for gay rights. I'm a card-carrying member of the ACLU. Keep abortion safe and legal.	|
|	`PS+`		|	=		|	My whole concept of liberalism is that nobody has the right to tell anybody else what to do, on either side of the political fence. If you don't like it, turn the bloody channel.	|
|	`PS`		|	=		|	I really don't have an opinion; nobody's messing with my freedoms right now.	|
|	`PS-`		|	=		|	Label records! Keep dirty stuff off the TV and the Internet.	|
|	`PS--`		|	=		|	Oppose sex education, abortion rights, and gay rights. Rush Limbaugh is my spokesman.	|
|	`PS---`		|	=		|	Repent left-wing sinners and change your wicked evil ways. Buchanan/Robertson in '96.	|


Politics and Economic Issues
------
Note this category has been reversed as of v4 to maintain the loose left+ and right- association from the PS category.

|				|			|				|
|:---			|	:---:	|	:---		|
|	`PE+++`		|	=		|	Capitalism is evil! Government should provide the services we really need. Nobody should be rich.	|

|	`PE`		|	=		|	Distrust both government and business.	|
|	`PE-`		|	=		|	It's ok to increase government spending, so we can help more poor people. Tax the rich! Cut the defense budget!	|
|	`PE--`		|	=		|	Balance the budget with spending cuts and an amendment.	|
|	`PE---`		|	=		|	Abolish antitrust legislation. Raise taxes on everyone but the rich so that the money can trickle-down to the masses.	|

ENTERTAINMENT
======

Geeks love to play. No matter their age, all geeks enjoy playing. Of course, the object of this entertainment takes a myriad of different forms. What is it that pushes a geek to play? Is it simply a desire to relive their childhood? Or perhaps there is a piece of geeky genetic code that requires intellectual stimulation. Who knows, maybe it's a Freudian thing…

|	`TST++`		|	=		|	It's the best show around. I have all the episodes and the movies on tape and can quote entire scenes verbatim. I've built a few of the model kits too. But you'll never catch me at one of those conventions. Those people are kooks.	|

|	`TST`		|	=		|	It's just another TV show	|

|	`TST--`		|	=		|	Star Trek is just another Space Opera. William Shatner isn't an actor, he's a poser! And what's with this Jean-Luc Picard? A Frenchman with a British accent? Come on. Isn't Voyager just a rehash of Lost in Space? Has Sisko even breathed in the last two seasons? Come on. I'd only watch this show if my remote control broke.	|
|	`TST---`	|	=		|	Star Trek SUCKS! It is the worst crap I have ever seen! Hey, all you Trekkies out there, GET A LIFE! (William Shatner is a t@#$)	|


RPG = Roleplaying
------

Role-playing games such as Dungeons & Dragons have long been a part of the traditional geek life. Because geeks often become so involved in their role-playing that they lose touch with reality, include one of the following role-playing codes.

|				|			|				|
|:---			|	:---:	|	:---		|
|	`RPG+++`	|	=		|	I've written and published my own gaming materials.	|
|	`RPG++`		|	=		|	There is no life outside the role of the die. I know all of the piddly rules of (chosen game). _MY_ own warped rules scare the rest of the players.	|
|	`RPG+`		|	=		|	I've got my weekly sessions set up and a character that I know better than I know myself.	|
|	`RPG`		|	=		|	Role-Playing? That's just something to do to kill a Saturday afternoon	|
|	`RPG-`		|	=		|	Gosh, what an utter waste of time!	|
|	`RPG--`		|	=		|	Role-Players are instruments of pure evil.	|
|	`RPG---`	|	=		|	I work for T$R.	|
|	`RPG?`		|	=		|	I thought life WAS role-playing?	|


BK = Books
------

In addition (or maybe on the other hand), many geeks have lives that revolve around books.

|				|			|				|
|:---			|	:---:	|	:---		|
|	`BK++++`	|	=		|	I read a book a day. I have library cards in three states. I have discount cards from every major bookstore. I've ordered books from another country to get my Favorite Author Fix.	|
|	`BK+++`		|	=		|	I consume a few books a week as part of a staple diet.	|
|	`BK++`		|	=		|	I find the time to get through at least one new book a month.	|
|	`BK+`		|	=		|	I enjoy reading, but don't get the time very often.	|
|	`BK`		|	=		|	I read the newspaper and the occasional book.	|
|	`BK-`		|	=		|	I read when there is no other way to get the information.	|
|	`BK--`		|	=		|	I take in knowledge by osmosis	|
|	`BK---`		|	=		|	I did not actually READ the geek code, I just had someone tell me.	|

K = Comics
------

|			|			|			|
|:---		|	:---:	|	:---	|
|	`KD`		|	=		|	Dilbert	|
|	`KX`		|	=		|	XKCD	|
|	`KM`		|	=		|	Manga	|
|	`KM!`		|	=		|	Hentai	|

You may append the code for comics with a modifier from --- to +++ to indicate how much of a fan you are.

LIFESTYLE
======

Geeks, unlike the lower lifeforms known as nerds, have lives. They have things to do that are in the outside world. Of course, this is usually done with other geeks, but that's not the point. The point is, that geeks are not necessarily the outcasts society often believes they are. The fact is that society isn't cool enough to be included in our activities.

MBTI / PERSONALITY
------

Most geeks have at one time or another taken a Myers & Briggs Type Indicator test. If you want to, include your letters in the code here.


R = Residence
------

Tell us about your geeky home.

|			|			|				|
|:---		|	:---:	|	:---		|
|	`R+++`		|	=		|	Living in a cave with 47 computers and an Internet feed, located near a Domino's pizza.	|
|	`R++`		|	=		|	Living alone, get out once a week to buy food, no more than once a month to do laundry. All surfaces covered.	|
|	`R+`		|	=		|	Friends come over to visit every once in a while to talk about Geek things. There is a place for them to sit.	|
|	`R`			|	=		|	Living with one or more registered Geeks.	|
|	`R-`		|	=		|	Living with one or more people who know nothing about being a Geek and refuse to watch geeky shows on TV.	|
|	`R--`		|	=		|	Married (or living romantically with someone.)	|
|	`R---`		|	=		|	Married with children – Al Bundy can sympathize	|
|	`R!` 		|	=		|	I am stuck living with my parents!	|
|	`R?` 		|	=		|	I'm not sure where I live anymore. This lab/workplace seems like home to me.	|

RELATIONSHIPS, SEX, AND GENDER
======

While many geeks are highly successful at having relationships, a good many more are not.

Geeks have traditionally had problems with sex (ie, they never have any). Because geeks are so wrapped up in their sexuality (or lack of sexuality), it is important that the geek be willing to quantify their sexual experiences.

This code also is used to denote the gender of the geek.

Share your pronouns followed by the modifier to show how successful you have been with relationships and sex.

Pronouns should always be lowercase to prevent them from being mistaken for current or future geekcode (which is capitalized in most cases).

|			|			|				|
|:---		|	:---:	|	:---		|
|	`*`			|	=		|	I'm a pervert	|
|	`**`		|	=		|	I've been known to make perverts look like angels.	|
|	`++++`		|	=		|	I've got a few rugrats to prove I've been there.	|
|	`+++`		|	=		|	Married, so I can get it (theoretically) whenever I want.	|
|	`++`		|	=		|	I was once referred to as 'easy'. I have no idea where that might have come from though.	|
|	`+`			|	=		|	I've had sex	|
|				|	=		|	I've had sex. Oh! You mean with someone else? Then no.	|
|	`-`			|	=		|	Not having sex by choice.	|
|	`--`		|	=		|	People just aren't interested in dating me...	|
|	`---`		|	=		|	Not having sex because I'm a nun or a priest.	|
|	`%`			|	=		|	signifying membership in the SBCA (Sour Bachelor(ette)'s Club of America). The motto is 'Bitter, but not Desperate'.	|
|	`!`			|	=		|	None of your business what my sex life is like!	|
|	`>+`		|	=		|	Desperate for experience	|

For example:

`he/him+++`

(Deprecated / Optional)
Females may use 'X' in this category. Males may use 'Y'. Other genders may use 'Q'. Those who are non-binary or do not wish to disclose their gender can use 'Z'.
